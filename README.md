# Telecom Churn Prediction Analysis

Telecom retention and churn prediction are crucial for managing customer relationships in the telecommunications industry. Churn refers to customers discontinuing services with a telecom company and switching to a competitor. To prevent churn and retain customers, telecom companies utilize churn prediction models that analyze various factors, such as customer behavior, service usage, personal details, and service quality. Advanced techniques like machine learning and predictive modeling are employed to identify customers who are likely to churn. By identifying potential churners in advance, telecom companies can take proactive measures to retain these customers.

## Importance of Managing Churn

Churn poses several challenges and impacts the telecom industry in the following ways:

1. **EBITDA Margin and Industry-Wide Challenge**: Churn significantly affects the EBITDA margin, which is a key performance indicator in the industry. Reducing churn rates is crucial for maintaining profitability and competitiveness.

2. **Revenue Loss and Increased Competition**: A churned customer ceases to generate revenue for the telecom company and may contribute to increased market share for competitors. Retaining customers helps preserve revenue and market position.

3. **Cost Efficiency**: Acquiring new subscribers is significantly more expensive (up to 5 times) than retaining existing customers. Managing churn can help minimize costs associated with customer acquisition.

## Types of Churn in the Telecom Industry

In the telecom industry, different types of churn can occur:

1. **Tariff Plan Churn**: Customers switch to a different tariff plan, usually to obtain a more cost-effective or desirable pricing structure.

2. **Service Churn**: Customers cancel or change their weekly or monthly subscriptions for various services offered by the telecom company.

3. **Product Churn**: Customers transition between different product offerings, such as switching from postpaid to prepaid services or vice versa.

4. **Usage Churn**: Customers become inactive or stop using the services altogether.

5. **Subscriber Churn**: Customers port out to a competitor, completely discontinuing their relationship with the current telecom provider.

## Decision Cycle of a Subscriber

A subscriber's decision regarding churn can be influenced by various factors. Here are different scenarios:

1. **Inert Subscriber**:
   - Reason: Perceives the process of switching providers as too complex, lacks time, or deems it not worth the effort.
   - Action: Unlikely to churn due to low motivation.

2. **Unconditionally Loyal Customer**:
   - Reason: Believes their current operator is the best option available.
   - Action: Unlikely to churn due to strong loyalty.

3. **Locked-In Subscriber**:
   - Reason: Bound by a contract or contractual obligation.
   - Action: Unlikely to churn until the contract expires.

4. **Conditional Churner**:
   - Reason: Found a better offer from a competitor.
   - Action: Considering churn but requires an attractive alternative offer.

5. **Lifestyle Migrator**:
   - Reason: Customer's needs have changed, and their current plan no longer aligns with their requirements.
   - Action: Considering churn to switch to a more suitable plan or provider.

6. **Unsatisfied Churner**:
   - Reason: Dissatisfaction with the telecom provider's services or customer experience.
   - Action: Considering churn due to poor satisfaction levels.

## Key Drivers Influencing Churn

Several factors can influence customer churn in the telecom industry. Key drivers include:

1. **Handset Loss/Upgrade**: Customers may churn due to issues related to their handset or the desire to upgrade to a newer device.

2. **Cost of Service/Competitor Pricing**: Pricing plays a significant role in customer decisions. Competitors offering lower-priced plans or better value can lead to churn.

3. **Network Quality**: Poor network coverage, frequent

 disruptions, or slow data speeds can contribute to customer dissatisfaction and churn.

4. **Customer Care Quality**: Inadequate customer service experiences, such as long wait times, unresolved issues, or unhelpful support, can drive churn.

## Key Drivers for Subscriber Loyalty

To foster subscriber loyalty, telecom companies should focus on key drivers that positively impact customer retention. These drivers include:

1. **Offer and Services**: Providing attractive offers, innovative services, and tailored solutions can enhance customer loyalty.

2. **Price**: Offering competitive pricing, discounts, and promotions can help retain customers.

3. **Quality of Products and Services**: Ensuring reliable and high-quality services, advanced network technology, and attractive service bundles can foster loyalty.

4. **Quality of Customer Service**: Delivering excellent customer service experiences, quick issue resolution, and personalized support contributes to customer satisfaction and loyalty.

5. **Length of Contract Period**: Long-term contract commitments can discourage customers from switching providers.

6. **Perception of Telecom Brand**: Maintaining a positive brand image and reputation through effective marketing and branding efforts can positively influence customer loyalty.

7. **Marketing Programs and Campaigns**: Engaging customers through targeted marketing campaigns, loyalty programs, and exclusive benefits can enhance loyalty and reduce churn.

## Data Science-Led Approach to Manage Churn

A data science-led approach can be employed to manage churn effectively. The process involves the following steps:

1. **Capture and Analyze**:
   - Gain a thorough understanding of the business requirements and objectives.
   - Identify the necessary data for churn prediction and explore its availability.
   - Request and extract the required data to build a churn prediction model.
   - Aggregate, clean, and standardize the data in the desired format for model training.

2. **Report and Predict**:
   - Conduct a business analysis of the standardized data to identify patterns and trends related to churn.
   - Design a churn prediction model based on business insights and data analysis.
   - Develop and implement the predictive model using advanced techniques like machine learning.
  
3. **Engage and Act**:
   - Determine a set of churn drivers and key performance indicators (KPIs) for tracking and monitoring churn.
   - Generate a list of recommended subscribers for targeted churn prevention campaigns.
   - Provide recommendations on monthly churn initiatives to reduce customer attrition.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In the context of telecom churn prediction, an initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) is crucial for understanding the dataset and identifying patterns. Here are the steps involved:

1. **Identify the Ratio of Churners**: Determine the proportion of churned customers versus active customers in the dataset. This provides an overview of the churn rate.

2. **Handling Missing Values**: Analyze the dataset for missing values. Apply suitable imputation techniques for features with a low number of missing values. For features with a high number of missing values, consider dropping those columns as they may not provide significant insights.

3. **Data Cleaning**: Perform necessary data cleaning tasks such as converting data types, handling null values, and creating new features to simplify the analysis. For example, create tenure groups by dividing customers based on their tenure period.

4. **Data Exploration**: Visualize the distribution of individual predictors based on churn status. Convert the target variable "Churn" into a binary numeric variable (1 for "Yes" and 0 for "No"). Convert categorical variables into dummy variables for further analysis. Explore relationships between predictors, such as Monthly Charges and Total Charges, to gain insights.

5. **Correlation Analysis**: Calculate correlations between predictors and churn to identify key drivers. Analyze the impact of variables like contract type, internet service, online security, tech support, and subscription duration on churn. Assess the influence of gender, phone service

, and multiple lines on churn.

Based on the EDA, generate insights about the dataset and identify potential predictors of churn.

## Insights after EDA

During the data exploration phase, an interesting insight was discovered: Churn is high when monthly charges are high, but surprisingly, higher churn is observed among customers with lower total charges. This suggests that customers with lower total charges may be more likely to churn, regardless of their monthly charges. This finding highlights the importance of considering the overall customer experience and value provided, beyond just the pricing structure, to effectively manage churn and retain customers.

This insight can guide telecom companies in developing targeted strategies to address the specific needs and concerns of customers with lower total charges, with the aim of improving customer satisfaction and reducing churn rates.

## Conclusion

Managing churn is essential for telecom companies to maintain profitability, retain customers, and stay competitive. By leveraging advanced techniques like machine learning and predictive modeling, telecom companies can identify customers at risk of churn and take proactive measures to retain them. Understanding the key drivers of churn and subscriber loyalty, along with effective data analysis and targeted campaigns, can significantly reduce churn rates and improve customer retention.
